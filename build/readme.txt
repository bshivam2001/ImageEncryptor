How to use this program:
1. Open up 'ImageEncryptor.exe'

2. Use the 'Select File' button to open an image. BMPs, PNGs and JPEGs are supported. 
If the image thumbnail appears in the viewer, the image has loaded correctly.

3. Enter a password in the textbox. 
AES only accepts 16 letter passwords, so any password you type is padded with dots ('.')

4. Click the 'Encrypt' button or the 'Decrypt' button depending on the desired operation. 
Note that decrypting a non-encrypted image will also produce an illegible image and cannot be recovered. 

Have fun encrypting!
